documentation outline:


- Getting started/Quick Start: 
	
	- Explanation of what metric learning is, and what is the purpose of this package
	- installation
	- a very quick example on how to import an algo (supervised or not ?) and how to do fit (and predict ?) (and split train and test) on some custom dataset (maybe sklearn.datasets.load_lfw_pairs ?)

- User Guide/List of algorithms: 

	- Supervised Metric Learning: (add links to examples/images from examples at the right place in the description)
		- Problem setting
		- Input data (+ see Preprocessor section)
		- What you can do after fit (transform...)
		- Scikit-learn compatibility (compatible with grid search + link to example of grid search)
		- List of algorithms + a more detailed description of each of them than
		 the one in the docstring

	- Weakly Supervised Metric Learning: (add links to examples/images from examples at the right place in the description)
		- Problem setting
		- Input data (+ See Preprocessor section)
		- What you can do after fit (predict/score, tranform...)
		- Scikit-learn compatibility (compatible with grid search + link to example of grid search)
		(more detailed than for supervised because more complicated)
		- List of algorithms + a more detailed description of each of them than
		 the one in the docstring
		
	- Somewhere: some section explaining Mahalanobis Metric Learning 
	(properties of the learned matrix etc)

	- Usage of the Preprocessor:
		- Purpose (performance)
		- Use (as an argument "preprocessor" in every metric learner)


- Examples/Tutorials: 
	- One example with faces (prediction if same/different person) 
	- One example of grid search to compare different algorithms (mmc, itml etc)
	- Clustering with side information
	- Instance retrieval
	- Dimensionality reduction

- API:
	- doc automatically generated by docstrings
