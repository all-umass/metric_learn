============
Contributing
============

This project is a community effort, and everyone is welcome
to contribute.

The project is hosted on https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/metric-learn/

The decision making process and governance structure of metric-learn
is laid out in the governance document: :ref:`governance`.

Metric-learn is somewhat selective when it comes to adding new
algorithms, and the best way to contribute and to help the project
is to start working on known issues. See Issues for New Contributors
to get started.

In case you experience issues using this package, do not hesitate to
submit a ticket to the `GitHub issue tracker
<https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/metric-learn/issues>`_.
You are also welcome to post feature requests or pull requests.

Our community, our values
=========================

We are a community based on openness and friendly, didactic, discussions.

We aspire to treat everybody equally, and value their contributions. We
are particularly seeking people from underrepresented backgrounds in Open
Source Software and scikit-learn in particular to participate and contribute
their expertise and experience.

Decisions are made based on technical merit and consensus.

Code is not the only way to help the project. Reviewing pull requests,
answering questions to help others on mailing lists or issues, organizing
and teaching tutorials, working on the website, improving the documentation,
are all priceless contributions.

We abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others
of the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/

Ways to contribute
==================

There are many ways to contribute to metric-learn, with the most common
ones being contribution of code or documentation to the project. Improving
the documentation is no less important than improving the library itself.
If you find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not
hesitate to send an email to the mailing list or preferably submit a GitHub
pull request. Full documentation can be found under the doc/ directory.

But there are many other ways to help. In particular helping to improve,
triage, and investigate issues and reviewing other developers’ pull
requests are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the
project maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you’re facing, and give a
“thumbs up” on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you.
It also helps us if you spread the word: reference the project from your
blog and articles, link to it from your website, or simply star to say
“I use it”:

In case a contribution/issue involves changes to the API principles or
changes to dependencies or supported versions, it must be backed by a
:ref:`mlep`, where a MLEP must be submitted as a new
`Github Discussion
<https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/metric-learn/discussions>`_
using the :ref:`mlep-template` and follows the decision-making process
outlined in metric-learn
:ref:`governance`.
