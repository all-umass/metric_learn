documentation outline:


- Getting started/Quick Start: 
	
	- Explanation of what metric learning is, and what is the purpose of this package
	- installation
	- a very quick example on how to import an algo (supervised or not ?) and how to do fit (and predict ?) (and split train and test) on some custom dataset (maybe sklearn.datasets.load_lfw_pairs ?)

- User Guide/List of algorithms: 

	- Supervised Metric Learning: (add links to examples/images from examples at the right place in the description)
		- Problem setting
		- Input data (+ see Preprocessor section)
		- What you can do after fit (transform...)

	- Weakly Supervised Metric Learning: (add links to examples/images from examples at the right place in the description)
		- Problem setting
		- Input data (+ See Preprocessor section)
		- What you can do after fit (predict/score, tranform...)
		- Scikit-learn compatibility (compatible with grid search + link to example of grid search)

	- Usage of the Preprocessor:
		- Purpose (performance)
		- Use (as an argument "preprocessor" in every metric learner)


- Examples/Tutorials: 
	- One example with faces (prediction if same/different person) 
	- One example of grid search to compare different algorithms (mmc, itml etc)
	- Clustering with side information
	- Instance retrieval

- API:
